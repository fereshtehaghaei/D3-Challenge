# Data Journalism and D3



#### Why make a static graphic when D3 lets you interact with your data?

In this project I analyzed the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand my findings.

This Data Driven Document(D3) project demonstrates building an interactive data visualization showing state-level data about three health risk factors (obesity, smoking and lack of healthcare) plotted against three perhaps underlying factors (income, poverty rate and age) based on 2014 U.S. Census data. The Chart was build using D3.js. Each marker represents an individual state in The USA.

The data set used in this analysis is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). I utilized information from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, create charts, graphs and interactive visualizations to help understand findings
